This program computes the components value
for switching regulator with mc34063
in step down, step up and invert mode.
It also prints on standard output aproximate values using
e12 series for resistors and timing capacitor Ct
e24 for R1 and R2
e6 for Lmin and Cout
Rsc is composed of three equal resistors in parallel
for increased power
Uses python3 and PySimpleGui
